## Introduction

The IKEA Retail Sales SQL Project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze retail data, including **sales records**, **store performance**, **product trends**, and **inventory status**. Using a robust schema, this project answers critical business questions and provides actionable insights to optimize IKEA's operational efficiency and profitability.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains SQL queries to create the database schema, populate tables, and perform analyses.
2. **Dataset**: Includes sales data, product information, store details, and inventory records.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries solve key business problems, leveraging advanced SQL techniques like joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

## SQL Queries & Analysis

All SQL queries developed for this project are available in the `Analysis.sql` file. The queries demonstrate advanced SQL skills, including:

- Aggregations with `GROUP BY`.
- Filtering data using `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
- Joining multiple tables to uncover insights.
- Using subqueries and window functions for complex analyses.
